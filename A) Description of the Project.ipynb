    "Hyperglycemia is classified into three categories: persistent hyperglycemia, transient hyperglycemia, and stress-induced hyperglycemia. Persistent hyperglycemia is primarily caused by diabetes mellitus, whereas transient hyperglycemia can result from severe systemic conditions such as infections, sepsis, acute myocardial infarction, and glucocorticoid treatment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stress hyperglycemia, also known as the oxidative stress response, arises from a variety of factors. Generally, when a patient undergoes surgery, the procedure itself causes stress to the body, leading to an increase in blood glucose levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common complications associated with hyperglycemia include surgical wound infections, pneumonia, sepsis, acute kidney injury, acute myocardial infarction, and stroke. These complications are linked to high morbidity and mortality rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The therapeutic approach for managing postoperative hyperglycemia typically involves administering insulin, either subcutaneously or intravenously. However, there is some debate within the medical community about the optimal glycemic target, though most published literature suggests an upper limit of 180 mg/dL.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, it is deemed beneficial to develop an algorithm capable of accurately predicting postoperative glucose levels to help prevent complications related to hyperglycemia."

    "To complete my education in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, I needed to undertake a diploma thesis. Since I aspire to become a data scientist/analyst, it seemed fitting for my thesis to focus on a data science project.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have a strong interest in the healthcare field, which led me to volunteer as a part-time data scientist/analyst in the Anesthesiology Department at Theagenio Anti-Cancer Hospital. I hoped to make a meaningful contribution to the work of the doctors there. After meeting with the hospital's anesthesiologists, we determined that it would be both meaningful and practically useful to create a model that predicts the postoperative blood glucose levels of patients undergoing thoracic surgeries."

    "With the help of the hospital's anesthesiologists, I managed to collect data on 235 patients who underwent thoracic surgery between March 2023 and September 2023. Typically, before an operation, patients undergo a preoperative checkup that gathers information about their general health, medical history, regular medications, habits, and blood test results. The data for my project was extracted from these preoperative checkup folders. "

    "During the data collection process, it was deemed necessary to exclude patients who fall into certain categories from the study. The following are some examples of patients who were excluded:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Duplicates**: Each patient was included in the sample only once. This decision was made because having patients with completely identical characteristics (e.g., same age, years of smoking, body mass index) but different glucose values in the training data could be harmful to the models.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Patients receiving corticosteroid medication pre-operatively**: These patients were excluded to determine whether the intra-operative administration of cortisol affects the response variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Patients with diabetes mellitus**: We excluded patients with diabetes mellitus from the sample, as the presence of glucose disorders post-operatively is expected for them. Furthermore, we considered it appropriate to examine whether the models could detect the change in post-operative glucose in patients who are not known to have diabetes mellitus beforehand or in patients who show increased insulin resistance (prediabetes).\n",
    "\n",
    "During the data collection, certain assumptions had to be made regarding some of the variables. The following describes the assumptions that were made:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Assumption on Smoking values**: Patients who declare themselves as active smokers within the last 28 days before surgery are defined as smokers, while over 60% of patients relapse within the first year after quitting smoking. The chronic damage caused by smoking significantly increases the likelihood of cardiovascular events, strokes, chronic lung disease, and various forms of cancer, including lung cancer. The chances of acute events begin to decrease significantly after two years of quitting smoking. Therefore, we deemed it appropriate to classify patients who quit smoking more than two years ago as non-smokers since recent cessation does not offer protection for the surgical patient from acute ischemic-type events accompanied by hyperglycemia.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Assumption on Pre-Operative Fast values**: The exact start time of pre-operative fasting is not known. According to the relevant guideline of the hospital's medical staff, fasting starts no later than 21:00. Therefore, the values of Pre-Operative Fast are derived from measuring the time from 9 p.m. the night before the surgery until the start time of the surgery. Surgeries start early in the morning, while typically, the last one is a few hours after noon."
