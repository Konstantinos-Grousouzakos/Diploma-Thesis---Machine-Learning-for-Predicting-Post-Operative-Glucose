# Diploma Thesis - Application of machine learning methods for predicting postoperative glucose value in thoracic surgeries

Hyperglycemia is classified into three categories: persistent hyperglycemia, transient hyperglycemia, and stress-induced hyperglycemia. Persistent hyperglycemia is primarily caused by diabetes mellitus, whereas transient hyperglycemia can result from severe systemic conditions such as infections, sepsis, acute myocardial infarction, and glucocorticoid treatment.

Stress hyperglycemia, also known as the oxidative stress response, arises from a variety of factors. Generally, when a patient undergoes surgery, the procedure itself causes stress to the body, leading to an increase in blood glucose levels.

The most common complications associated with hyperglycemia include surgical wound infections, pneumonia, sepsis, acute kidney injury, acute myocardial infarction, and stroke. These complications are linked to high morbidity and mortality rates.

The therapeutic approach for managing postoperative hyperglycemia typically involves administering insulin, either subcutaneously or intravenously. However, there is some debate within the medical community about the optimal glycemic target, though most published literature suggests an upper limit of 180 mg/dL.

Therefore, it is deemed beneficial to develop an algorithm capable of accurately predicting postoperative glucose levels to help prevent complications related to hyperglycemia.

To complete my education in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, I needed to undertake a diploma thesis. Since I aspire to become a data scientist/analyst, it seemed fitting for my thesis to focus on a data science project.

I have a strong interest in the healthcare field, which led me to volunteer as a part-time data scientist/analyst in the Anesthesiology Department at Theagenio Anti-Cancer Hospital. I hoped to make a meaningful contribution to the work of the doctors there. After meeting with the hospital's anesthesiologists, we determined that it would be both meaningful and practically useful to create a model that predicts the postoperative blood glucose levels of patients undergoing thoracic surgeries.

With the help of the hospital's anesthesiologists, I managed to collect data on 235 patients who underwent thoracic surgery between March 2023 and September 2023. Typically, before an operation, patients undergo a preoperative checkup that gathers information about their general health, medical history, regular medications, habits, and blood test results. The data for my project was extracted from these preoperative checkup folders. 

1. **Build Models:** Develop models to predict postoperative glucose levels.  
2. **Compare Models:** Evaluate and compare the performance of the models to determine if one is more efficient than the others. 
3. **Estimate Feature Importance:** Assess the importance of each feature in the models to understand which factors most significantly impact postoperative glucose predictions.
